# motherless_downloader
#A bash script that will download any video from MOTHERLESS.COM Given the URL from the videopage, in WD(current dir)
# motherless_downloader.sh 
#The working script. I have some problems with the auto-naming. So decided to make one where the user provides the name.
#So, assuming you have placed the script in a place where the shell can find it. (e.x.:~/bin/motherless_downloader)
#You can use it like this: dude@pc:~$ motherless_downloader [URL] [FileName] //Filename without .mp4!!




# motherless_downloader_A.sh
#Does not work yet
#Filenaming: VideoTitle-DateOfDownload.mp4
#Usage motherless_downloader [URL]
#///////////////////////////////
#EXAMPLE: dude@pc:~$ motherless_downloader http://motherless.com/4377D02
